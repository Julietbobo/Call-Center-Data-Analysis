- Visualization with bar charts, line charts, doughnut charts, time slicer and slicers for state, customer sentiments and reason for calling to create an interactive 
 dashboard.
### Exploratory data analysis

1. What was the total number of calls made over a specific period?
2. What was the most common reasons customers call?
3. What was the overall sentiment distribution (positive, neutral, negative)?
4. What communication methods do customers prefer?
5. Is the response time within the SLA?

5. Most customers prefer using the call_center
6. 62.61% of the calls were within the SLA
### Conclusion
Billing questions is the reason why most people called and the cause of the high number of very negative sentiments.

### Recommendation
Look into why customers are having problems with bills. It could be that they are wrongly charged due to a problem with the billing system hence the very negative sentiments.
